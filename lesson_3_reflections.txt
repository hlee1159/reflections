When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   When I have to use a different computer. When other people are helping me out.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would like to pull changes manually because I might not be ready to implement the changes. I will have to look and see if staying up-to-date would be beneficial.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is copying within GitHub. It recognizes the original maker of the code. Cloning occurs between GitHub and a local directory. Branch only occurs within local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I can do my job offline. I can merge any changes I made later easily, too.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would have to seem them in person or transfer txt files back and forth. This would be much more difficult than using GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would want to make changes in a separate branch if the change needs to be confirmed by someone else. This approach lets me double check whether my change is for the better.
